# Project27_2020

Open Final "Report file" and "Final Presentation" for project description.

Our final phase 1-3 project product is run in the way we were told to run it.
To run our ProjectPhase3.java file (for phase 1-3), we need to first compile it in the Command Prompt:
                                                                                -"javac ProjectPhase3.java"
After compiling the file, we just need to run it with a txt file (a graph file).
For example:
        -"java ProjectPhase3 phase3_2020_graph01.txt"

This is how you run our (group 27s) code. :)
